# NXR-Command-Line
This is a basic command interpereter that I've been working on.

It's a bit noob-ish, so please don't slate me behind my back )))

As usual, everything takes place in Main.cpp, and it should be fairly self-contained. Build and run if you want to use it, but just bear in mind that it IS copyright me :)
